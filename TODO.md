## Style TODOs:

- [ ] Add hyphenation entries for all unknown words.

- [x] Clean and consistent tables.

- [ ] Syntax highlighting of code (one option: pygments can output to tex).

- [x] Consistent example formatting (>>> style, str printer, note at beginning
  that `from sympy import *` is assumed).

- [ ] Avoid too much itemize.

- [ ] "Other projects that use SymPy" section should use a table.

- [ ] Add Unicode pretty printing example (see discussion on #89).

- [x] Code examples use curly quotes (’) instead of regular quotes (').

- [ ] Stylize code examples with decent colors.

- [ ] Should we use listings for the code examples?

## Content TODOs:

- [x] De-duplicate content in assumptions architecture section and assumptions
  features section.

- [ ] Mention all major algorithms that are implemented, even if they aren't
  discussed in-depth.

- [ ] Write the Gruntz algorithm section as actual text.

- [x] Clean up "basic operations".

- [ ] Move "sets" details in to citations/supplement.

- [ ] Move solvers details into citations/supplement.

- [x] Clean up matrices section.

- [x] Move series stuff to supplement.

- [x] Move logic stuff to supplement.

- [ ] Move vector and physics stuff to supplement.

- [x] Move SymPy Gamma/Live stuff to supplement.

- [x] Either flesh out CAS comparison section with other CASs or move to
  supplement.

- [ ] Address all inline TODOs in the .tex files.

- [ ] Make sure features table isn't missing anything.

- [x] Rearrange basic usage before the architecture.

## Citations:

- [ ] Make sure everything that needs to be cited is cited.

- [ ] Make sure the citations we have are good ones. We should avoid software
citations and "URL citations".

- [ ] "Other projects that use SymPy" needs real citations (not URLs)

- [ ] Fix citation of Mathematica.

## Sections that need to be written:

- [ ] Abstract (note: write this last)

- [ ] Introduction

- [ ] Polynomials module architecture (if we can't get anyone to write it, add
  a blurb and cite Mateusz's thesis)

- [x] Something on printers

- [x] Conclusion
