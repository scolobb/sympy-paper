SymPy includes several packages that allow users to solve domain specific
problems. For example, a comprehensive physics package is included that is
useful for solving problems in classical mechanics, optics, and quantum
mechanics along with support for manipuating physical quantities with units.


\subsection{Classical Mechanics}

\subsubsection{Vector Algebra}

The \verb|sympy.physics.vector| package provides reference frame, time, and
space aware vector and dyadic objects that allow for three dimensional
operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, inner and
outer products, cross products, etc. Both of these objects can be written in
very compact notation that make it easy to express the vectors and dyadics in
terms of multiple reference frames with arbitrarily defined relative
orientations. The vectors are used to specify the positions, velocities, and
accelerations of points, orientations, angular velocities, and angular
accelerations of reference frames, and force and torques. The dyadics are
essentially reference frame aware $3 \times 3$ tensors. The vector and dyadic
objects can be used for any one-, two-, or three-dimensional vector algebra and
they provide a strong framework for building physics and engineering tools.

The following Python interpreter session showing how a vector is created using
the orthogonal unit vectors of three reference frames that are oriented with
respect to each other and the result of expressing the vector in the $A$
frame. The $B$ frame is oriented with respect to the $A$ frame using Z-X-Z
Euler Angles of magnitude $\pi$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, and
$\frac{\pi}{3}$\si{\radian}, respectively whereas the $C$ frame is oriented
with respect to the $B$ frame through a simple rotation about the $B$ frame's
X unit vector through $\frac{\pi}{2}$\si{\radian}.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy import pi
>>> from sympy.physics.vector import ReferenceFrame
>>> A = ReferenceFrame('A')
>>> B = ReferenceFrame('B')
>>> C = ReferenceFrame('C')
>>> B.orient(A, 'body', (pi, pi / 3, pi / 4), 'zxz')
>>> C.orient(B, 'axis', (pi / 2, B.x))
>>> v = 1 * A.x + 2 * B.z + 3 * C.y
>>> v
A.x + 2*B.z + 3*C.y
>>> v.express(A)
A.x + 5*sqrt(3)/2*A.y + 5/2*A.z
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Mechanics}

The \verb|sympy.physics.mechanics| package utilizes the \texttt{sympy.\allowbreak{}physics.\allowbreak{}vector} package
to populate time aware particle and rigid body objects to fully describe the
kinematics and kinetics of a rigid multi-body system. These objects store all
of the information needed to derive the ordinary differential or differential
algebraic equations that govern the motion of the system, i.e., the equations
of motion. These equations of motion abide by Newton's laws of motion and can
handle any arbitrary kinematical constraints or complex loads. The package
offers two automated methods for formulating the equations of motion based on
Lagrangian Dynamics~\cite{Lagrange1811} and Kane's Method~\cite{Kane1985}. Lastly, there
are automated linearization routines for constrained dynamical
systems based on~\cite{Peterson2014}.

\subsection{Symbolic Quantum Mechanics}

The \verb|sympy.physics.quantum| package has extensive capabilities for
symbolic quantum mechanics, with Python objects to represent the different
mathematical objects relevant in quantum theory \cite{Sakurai2010}: states
(bras and kets), operators (unitary, hermitian, etc.) and basis sets as well
as operations on these objects such as representations, tensor products, inner
products, outer products, commutators, anticommutators, etc. The base objects
are designed in the most general way possible to enable any particular quantum
system to be implemented by subclassing the base operators to provide system
specific logic.

For example, you can define symbolic quantum operators and states and perform
a full range of operations with them:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy.physics.quantum import Commutator, Dagger, Operator
>>> from sympy.physics.quantum import Ket, qapply
>>> A = Operator('A')
>>> B = Operator('B')
>>> C = Operator('C')
>>> D = Operator('D')
>>> a = Ket('a')
>>> comm = Commutator(A, B)
>>> comm
[A,B]
>>> qapply(Dagger(comm*a)).doit()
-<a|*(Dagger(A)*Dagger(B) - Dagger(B)*Dagger(A))
\end{verbatim}
Commutators can be expanded using common commutator identities:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> Commutator(C+B, A*D).expand(commutator=True)
-[A,B]*D - [A,C]*D + A*[B,D] + A*[C,D]
\end{verbatim}

On top of this set of base objects, a number of specific quantum systems have been implemented. These include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Position/momentum operators and states, raising/lowering operators and states, simple harmonic oscillator, density matrices, hydrogen atom.

\item Second quantized formalism of non-relativistic many-body quantum mechanics
\cite{FetterWalecka2003}.

\item Quantum angular momentum \cite{Zare1991}. Spin operators and their
eigenstates can be represented in any basis and for any quantum numbers.
Facilities for Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients, Wigner Coefficients, rotations,
and angular momentum coupling are also present in their symbolic and numerical
forms.


\item Quantum information and computing \cite{Nielsen2011}. Multidimensional
qubit states, and a full set of one- and two-qubit gates are provided and can
be represented symbolically or as matrices/vectors. With these building blocks
it is possible to implement a number of basic quantum algorithms including the
quantum Fourier transform, quantum error correction, quantum teleportation,
Grover's algorithm, dense coding, etc.


\end{itemize}

Here are a few short examples of the quantum information and computing capabilities in \verb|sympy.physics.quantum|. We start with a simple 4 qubit state and flip one of the qubits:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy.physics.quantum.qubit import Qubit
>>> q = Qubit('0101')
>>> q
|0101>
>>> q.flip(1)
|0111>
\end{verbatim}
Qubit states can also be used in adjoint operations, tensor products, inner/outer products:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> Dagger(q)
<0101|
>>> ip = Dagger(q)*q
>>> ip
<0101|0101>
>>> ip.doit()
1
\end{verbatim}
Quantum gates (unitary operators) can be applied to transform these states and then classical measurements can be performed on the results:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy.physics.quantum.qubit import Qubit, measure_all
>>> from sympy.physics.quantum.gate import H, X, Y, Z
>>> from sympy.physics.quantum.qapply import qapply
>>> c = H(0)*H(1)*Qubit('00')
>>> c
H(0)*H(1)*|00>
>>> q = qapply(c)
>>> measure_all(q)
[(|00>, 1/4), (|01>, 1/4), (|10>, 1/4), (|11>, 1/4)]
\end{verbatim}

\caption{The circuit diagram for a 3-qubit quantum fourier transform
generated by SymPy.}
\label{fig-circuitplot-qft}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Here is a final example of creating a 3-qubit quantum fourier transform, decomposing it into one- and two-qubit gates, and then generating a circuit plot for the sequence of gates (see Figure~\ref{fig-circuitplot-qft}).
\begin{verbatim}
>>> from sympy.physics.quantum.qft import QFT
>>> from sympy.physics.quantum.circuitplot import circuit_plot
>>> fourier = QFT(0,3).decompose()
>>> fourier
SWAP(0,2)*H(0)*C((0),S(1))*H(1)*C((0),T(2))*C((1),S(2))*H(2)
>>> c = circuit_plot(fourier, nqubits=3)
\end{verbatim}
