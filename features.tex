% Features to discuss in-depth:

SymPy has an extensive feature set that encompasses too much to cover
in-depth here. Bedrock areas, such a Calculus, recieve thier own sub-sections
below. Additionally, Table \ref{features-table} describes other capabilities
present in the SymPy code base. This gives a sampling from the breadth of
topics and application domains that SymPy services.

\caption{SymPy Features and Descriptions}
\begin{tabular}[htbc]{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
Discrete Math & Summations, products, binomial coefficients, prime number
    tools, integer factorization, Diophantine equation solving, and
    boolean logic representation, equivalence testing, and inference.\\
Concrete Math & Tools for determining whether summation and product
    expressions are convergent, absolutely convergent, hypergeometric, and
    other properties. May also compute Gosper's normal form
    \cite{petkovvsek1996bak} for two univariate polynomials.\\
Plotting & Hooks for visualizing expressions via matplotlib \cite{Hunter:2007}
    or as text drawings when lackinga graphical backend.\\
Geometry & Allows the creation of 2D geometrical entities,
    such as lines and circles. Enables queries on these entities, including
    asking the area of an ellipse, checking for collinearity of a set of
    points, or finding the intersection between two lines.\\
Statistics & Support for a random variable type as well as the ability to
    declare this variable from prebuilt distribution functions such as
    Normal, Exponential, Coin, Die, and other custom distributions.\\
Polynomials & Computes polynomial algebras over various coefficient domains
    ranging from the simple (e.g. polynomial division) to the advanced
    (e.g. Gr\"obner bases \cite{adams1994introduction} and multivariate
    factorization over algebraic number domains).\\
Sets & Representations of empty, finite, and infinite sets. This includes
    special sets such as for all natural, integer, and complex numbers.\\
Series & Impelements series expansion, sequences, and limit of sequences.
    This includes special series, such as Fouier and power series.\\
Vectors & Provides basic vector math and differential calculus with respect
    to 3D Cartesian coordinate systems.\\
Matrices & Tools for creating matrices of symbols and expressions.
    This is capable of both sparse and dense representations and performing
    symbolic linear algebraic operations (e.g. inversion and factorization).\\
Combinatorics \& Group Theory & Implements permutations, combinations,
    partitions, subsets,
    various permutation groups (such as polyhedral, rubik, symmetric,
    and others), Gray codes \cite{Nijenhuis1978combinatorial},
    and Prufer sequences \cite{biggs1976graph}.\\
Code Generation & Enables generation of compilable and executable
    code in a variety of different programming languages directly from
    expressions. Target languages include C, Fortran, Julia, JavaScript,
    Mathematica, Matlab and Octave, Python, and Theano.\\
Tensors & Symbolic manipultion of indexed objects.\\
Lie Algebras & Represents Lie algebras and root systems.\\
Cryptography & Represents block and stream ciphers, including
    shift, Affine, substitution, Vigenere's, Hill's, bifid, RSA, Kid RSA,
    linear-feedback shift registers, and Elgamal encryption\\
Special Functions & Implements a number of well known special functions,
    including Dirac delta, Gamma, Beta, Gauss error functions, Fresnel
    integrals, Exponential integrals, Logarithmic integrals, Trigonomentic
    integrals, Bessel, Hankel, Airy, B-spline, Riemann Zeta, Dirchlet eta,
    polylogarithm, Lerch transcendent, hypergeometric, elliptic integrals,
    Mathieu, Jacobi polynomials, Gegenbauer polynomial, Chebyshev polynomial,
    Legendre polynomial, Hermite polynomial, Laguerre polynomial, and
    spherical harmonic functions.\\
