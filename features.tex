% Features to discuss in-depth:

% Basic operations (the core)
\subsection{Basic Operations}
% Including the assumptions system

% Calculus (differentiation, integration, limits). Note that algorithm
% descriptions will go in the algorithms section.
\subsection{Calculus}

% Solvers (regular equations, maybe also mention other types of solvers like ODEs/recurrence/Diophantine)
\subsection{Solvers}

% Matrices (worth including to stress that they are symbolic)
\subsection{Matrices}

% Physics module (some sampling, to show that it is there)
