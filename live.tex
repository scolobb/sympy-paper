SymPy Live is an online Python shell, which runs on Google
App Engine, that executes SymPy code. It is integrated in the SymPy
documentation examples, located at this \href{http://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html}{link}.

This is accomplished by providing a HTML/JavaScript GUI for entering
source code and visualization of output, and a server part which
evaluates the requested source code. It's an interactive AJAX shell,
that runs SymPy code using Python on the server.

Certain Features of SymPy Live:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It supports the exact same syntax as SymPy, hence it can be used
  easily, to test for outputs of various SymPy expressions.
\item
  It can be run as a standalone app or in an existing app as an
  admin-only handler, and can also be used for system administration
  tasks, as an interactive way to try out APIs, or as a debugging aid
  during development.
\item
  It can also be used to plot figures (\href{http://live.sympy.org/?evaluate=from\%20sympy\%20import\%20symbols\%0Afrom\%20sympy.plotting\%20import\%20textplot\%0Ax\%20\%3D\%20symbols(\%27x\%27)\%0Atextplot(x**2\%2C0\%2C5)\%0A\%23--\%0A}{link}),
  and execute all kinds of expressions that SymPy can evaluate.
\item
SymPy Live also formats the output in LaTeX for pretty-printing the
output.
\end{itemize}
