Ongoing work to provide the capabilities of tensor computer algebra has so far
produced the \verb|tensor| module.  It is composed of three separated
submodules, whose purposes are quite different: \verb|tensor.indexed| and
\verb|tensor.indexed_methods| support indexed symbols,
\verb|tensor.array| contains facilities to operator on symbolic $N$-dimensional
arrays and finally \verb|tensor.tensor| is used to defineabstract tensors.
The abstract tensors subsection
is inspired by xAct\cite{xAct} and Cadabra\cite{Peeters2007cadabra}.
Canonicalization based on the Butler-Portugal\cite{ManssurPortugal1999}
algorithm is supported in SymPy.  It is currently limited to polynomial tensor
expressions.
